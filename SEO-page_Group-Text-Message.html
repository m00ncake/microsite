    <p class="mb-3">According to Salesforce, brands that use group text to market get an <a
            href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2016/11/sms-marketing.html">open rate of 98%</a>. When compared with
        the
        average open rate of email at <a
            href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/">21%</a>, you can see why many
        organizations are using group text messaging as a primary marketing and outreach channel.</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">And the benefits don't stop with phenomenal open rates. Salesforce also found that group texts convert at 45%,
        and,
        on average, are read within 5 seconds of being received.</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">Group texting helps thousands of businesses, community groups, schools, and faith-based organizations communicate
        with a large number of people simultaneously. Sending group texts is one of the most effective ways to notify,
        engage, and promote your organization.</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">This outreach strategy is a proven success because it is:</p>

    <ul class="pt-1">
        <li class="pb-1"><strong>Simple - </strong>You do not have to have advanced technical or design skills to send a group text
            message. Short Message Service (SMS) software providers like EZ Texting make interfaces which are simple to
            use
            and can be accessed from any Internet-connected device.</li>
        <li class="py-1"><strong>Inexpensive -</strong> Group texting costs just pennies per message. With the high level of response
            that it generates, text messaging yields a strong ROI for businesses who use it as part of their overall
            mobile
            marketing strategy.</li>
        <li class="py-1"><strong>Effective -</strong> Because mobile phones are always close by, they have become one of the most
            reliable outreach tools for companies. But just how effective a tool is texting?</li>

    <h2 class="mb-5 mt-2">Group Text Messaging for Organizations</h2>

    <p class="text-left mb-3 pb-1">Whether you realize it or not, you have probably been exposed to group text messages
        in one way or another. The most common use of group text messaging is by retailers inviting you to take
        advantage of a special offer by texting a keyword to a dedicated number - for example, "Text PIZZA to 313131."
        However, retail is not the only industry in which group text messaging is used.</p>

        immediacy it provides in spreading awareness to students of school events. It can also be used to advise parents
        of school closures or synchronize campus personnel in the event of an emergency. Many learning institutions have
        been advocates for mass text messaging during these times, as texting still works even when data networks become

        usually free and easy (our setup takes less than 5 minutes). Once you’re logged in, you simply compose your

    <p class="mb-3">Group text messaging also helps you personalize messages by enabling you to send to different groups. Not every
        contact will care about every special offer, event, or volunteer opportunity, so by dividing your database into
        various groups, you can ensure each message you send is relevant. A good example of this is a large department
        store that has customers with different interests. By dividing them into groups based on interest levels or
        purchase history, you can avoid the scenario of sending health-focused contacts a special discount on cake
        frosting.</p>

    <p class="pt-1">The benefits of this feature are two-fold:</p>

    <ol class="mb-3">
        <li class="pb-1">You reduce the number of messages you send out (and pay for)</li>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3"><a href="/pricing">Subscribing to a messaging service is free</a>, but you still pay for

    <p class="pt-1">Before you subscribe to a group text message service, it is important to understand that this is a

        does not mean you have permission to text them. To create your database, you have to do three things:</p>

    <ol class="mb-3">
        <li class="pb-1">Invite new contacts to join your texting list</li>
        <li class="py-1">Provide confirmation they've joined (and next steps, if applicable)</li>
        <li class="py-1">Give them instructions on how they can opt out and inform them how often they'll be texted</li>

<div class="text-left">
    <p class="mb-3">There are various tools available to help you create a group messaging database, but none are simpler and more
        effective than Keywords and short codes. Keywords are the words that you ask your potential contacts to text to
        a short code number in order to opt into the group message service. The example of this process we gave above
        was "Text PIZZA to 313131 to get weekly specials."</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">Keywords and short code numbers are provided by your service provider and can be included free in a subscription
        package. Most organizations tend to need just one keyword to create their group messaging database, but you can
        use multiple Keywords to market multiple offers simultaneously, pre-sort your database into interest sub-groups,
        or segment contacts geographically.</p>

    <p class="pt-1">Other tools for creating a group messaging database include&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.eztexting.com/features/signup-widgets">signup forms (widgets)</a>&nbsp;which can be placed
        on your website or social media channels. Forms are a great way to add customers to your database. To get the
        most bang for your buck, consider offering a promotion or secret discount to entice people to sign up. Further,
        each signup widget can be assigned its own keyword so customers are automatically funneled into different groups
        based on their interests.</p>

    <h2>The Difference between Group Messaging Software and a Group Messaging App</h2>
</div>

<!--      Content 1        -->
<div class="text-left">
    <p class="mb-3">Some people may look at group texting software and think it performs the same function as a group text app.
        However, there are two significant differences. The first is that apps such as Skype and WhatsApp limit the
        number of members you can have in a group. The second is that these apps can only be used to contact other
        smartphone users (cell phones are a ‘similar but different’ product and can rarely run apps).</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">While mobile phone-based apps like the ones above have a lot of limitations, there are significant business and
        organizational advantages to using a&nbsp;<a href="/bulk-sms">bulk texting
            service</a>&nbsp;like EZ Texting:</p>

    <ul class="pt-1">
        <li>Texting has a higher customer satisfaction rating (90%) than any other communications channel</li>
        <li>It can lower the cost of a $20 customer service call to just pennies</li>
        <li>44% of customers prefer receiving a message via text over any other medium</li>

<!--      Content 1        -->
<div class="text-left">
    <p class="mb-3">Group texting isn’t just a way to break through the marketing clutter. It can also be a valuable tool to learn
        more about what your contacts like and want from you. By adding polls and surveys to your group texts, you can
        invite your contacts to express their opinions on everything from finance and politics to their favorite pizza
        toppings.</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">Polls are easy to build on a group texting platform. You simply text a question like “What is your favorite pizza
        topping?”, and ask your customers to reply using Keywords that express their preferences. This information can
        help shape future marketing campaigns, guide product development, and assist with stocking decisions.</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">Want to grow your database more organically? Ask a provocative question! Friends and colleagues are inclined to
        share media they find interesting; if the question you ask in your survey sparks a discussion, your question
        (and company info) can go viral in much the same way as a popular video posted on Facebook or YouTube.</p>

    <p class="pt-1">Other tools you can use to encourage feedback and engagement include adding photos or files to your group texts
        via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). MMS group texting allows you to attach a picture (including gifs),
        audio, or video file either to complement your plain text message or to replace it completely. You can also
        attach coupons to your group texts, add scannable QR codes, or integrate tiny URLs linking to web pages that
        provide further information.</p>

<div class="text-left">
    <p class="mb-3">The legal requirements for group texting are contained within the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) of
        1991. A lot of things have changed in the past 25+ years, so the Act has frequently been updated - most
        noticeably following the passage of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Compliance with the Act is overseen by the Federal
        Communications Commission (FCC).</p>

    <p class="pt-1 mb-3">Organizations are also expected to adhere to the&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.mmaglobal.com/files/codeofconduct.pdf">Mobile Marketing Association´s Code of
            Conduct</a>&nbsp;– even for non-commercial purposes. The code includes best practices to protect the mobile
        channel from abuse, limit consumer backlash, and avoid the need for additional regulations.</p>

    <p class="pt-1">In addition to the TCPA and Code of Conduct, phone carriers (the telephone companies that carry and deliver text
        messages) impose their own restrictions on what can be included in group texts. Most carriers will block
        messages containing any of the following:</p>

    <ol class="list-column mb-3">
        <li>Violence</li>
        <li>Illegal drug use</li>
        <li>Adult material</li>
        <li>Profanity</li>
        <li>Hate speech</li>
        <li>Content deemed inappropriate</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="pt-1">These restrictions apply to both SMS and MMS messages. Moreover, if you send text messages to your database
        containing material they do not want to receive or send them so frequently they become annoying, your members
        will start opting out.</p>
