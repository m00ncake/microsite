 <br />
    This Privacy Statement covers EZ Texting&rsquo;s information practices for our family of websites (collectively, &quot;EZ Texting Sites&quot;). In addition to EZTexting.com, EZ Texting operates other websites like MoboMix.com, CallFire.com, GroupTexting.com, TellMyCell.com, NightLifeTexting.com, and ClubTexting.com.

 <strong>2. Information EZ Texting Collects From You</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 EZ Texting collects information from individuals who visit any of our Sites (&quot;Visitors&quot;), as, well as from individuals who have registered to use our platform services (&ldquo;Customers&rdquo;).<br />
 <br />
 Some information is collected from both Visitors and Customers using commonly-used information-gathering tools. It includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address, and the actions you take on the EZ Texting Sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). This information is collectively called &ldquo;Website Navigational Information.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 EZ Texting collects your Website Navigational Information using these methods:
 </p>
 <p class="bullet">
 <strong>Cookies</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 EZ Texting uses cookies to make your interactions with our Sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of our Sites, EZ Texting&#39;s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to EZ Texting by, for example, responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (like a &quot;Contact Me&quot; or a &quot;30-Day Free Trial&quot; Web form), you remain anonymous when visiting our Sites.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet-left">
 There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet-left">
 If you have chosen to identify yourself to EZ Texting, we can uniquely identify you as you navigate our Sites by using session cookies containing encrypted information. For example, each time you request a free trial or promotion by providing your contact information or each time you login to your account portal, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to you is placed on your browser. It enables us to process your online requests and to uniquely identify who is logged into the Service. Session cookies are required to use our Services,&nbsp;<strong>and we do not recognize do-not-track requests for them.</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="bullet-left">
 EZ Texting uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the EZ Texting Sites. When you purchase our Services or otherwise provide us with your personal information, a unique identifier associated with a persistent cookie placed on your Web browser is assigned to you. <strong>We do not respond to do-not-track requests with respect to persistent cookies.</strong>
 </p>
 <p class="bullet-left">
 We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
 </p>

 From time-to-time, EZ Texting engages third parties to track and analyze nonpersonally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from Visitors and Customers who visit our Sites. EZ Texting also uses other third-party cookies to track the performance of our advertisements.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet">
 <strong>Web Beacons</strong>

 </div>
 <div class="policy-row">
 <p class="bullet-left">
 EZ Texting uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors&#39; usage of our Sites and your interactions with emails that we have sent you.
