    <p class="mb-3">Bulk messaging uses SMS technology to send text messages simultaneously to groups of contacts. It requires that the organization has a database of contacts who have given their permission to be contacted by SMS text.</p>

    Due to its cost, reach and simplicity, bulk texting is often used by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eztexting.com/sms-faith-based-engagement">faith-based organizations</a>&nbsp;to connect with their communities. Volunteers can be coordinated by bulk text, prayers requested for those in need, and parishioners sent inspirational messages related to the previous week´s sermon. Bulk texting can also be used to keep in touch with parishioners unable to attend church ministries.

    <p>For non-retail businesses, bulk texting represents an effective way of communicating with groups of employees when email is unavailable - if, for example, a sales team was on the road in an area with no mobile Internet service. It can also be used in times of emergency when data services are overloaded, or as a means of advising job seekers of vacancies within the business, or the status of their applications.</p>

<div class="text-left"><a href="https://www.eztexting.com/sms-schools-and-universities">Schools</a>&nbsp;are another example of where bulk texting can be effective. Schools can divide their database of contacts into groups of students, parents, teachers, and administrators so that each group can be informed instantly and simultaneously of important school events. Again, bulk text messaging can be of vital importance in times of emergency to keep students safe and parents informed.

    Possibly the most significant non-commercial bulk text message occurred in 2008, when President
    Obama announced Joe Biden as his running mate. Approximately&nbsp;<strong>three million Americans</strong>&nbsp;
    opted-in to the President´s bulk text messaging service to hear the news first. Those three million contacts subsequently 
    generated&nbsp;<strong>record-breaking political donations</strong>&nbsp;that contributed to the President´s re-election in 2012.

    President Obama may have been the first to solicit donations by bulk text, but he wasn´t the last.
    Many charitable organizations, churches and community projects now use bulk texting as a way of raising funds.
    Political parties continue to raise funds using “text-to-donate” campaigns, as well as taking advantage of a bulk
    text messaging service to “Get Out the Vote” on Election Day.

</div>

<!--      Content 1        -->
<div class="text-left">
    <p>Most people will have been exposed to keywords and short codes (for example - text "PIZZA" to 313131 in order to
        receive a free drink with your next order) without necessarily recognizing their full potential. When a contact
        texts the keyword to the short code, they are invited to opt into the business´s bulk SMS service - usually to
        take advantage of future promotions.</p>

    <p>When the contact opts in, they are automatically added to the business´s database maintained in the group texting
        platform according to the keyword they used. This enables businesses to manage their databases effectively, send
        targeted campaigns to groups with specific interests, and avoid the scenario in which contacts opt out of the
        service for receiving too many irrelevant text messages. Keywords (or, more specifically, sub-keywords) and
        short codes can also be used to conduct&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eztexting.com/features/text-2-vote-sms-polls">polls and surveys</a>.</p>

    <p>There are many different ways in which bulk text polls can be used to generate engagement and build brand
        awareness. When a particular poll catches the public's imagination, it can often be shared among families and
        friends, going viral and expanding the reach of the business´s or organization´s bulk text messaging service and
        prompting new contacts to opt into the service.</p>

<!--      Content 1        -->
<div class="text-left">
    <p>Bulk text messaging does not have to be limited to plain text messages. Businesses and organizations can increase
        the impact of their communications by replacing their plain text messages with&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.eztexting.com/mms-marketing-for-business">multimedia (MMS) messages</a>&nbsp;that
        incorporate content such as images, video, and audio. MMS bulk texting also gives organizations the option of
        sending out messages in excess of 160 characters or using Unicode non-standard characters.</p>

    <p>Most cell phones and smartphones are capable of receiving MMS bulk text messages, and the impact MMS messages
        have - particularly for retail businesses - is significant. MMS bulk text messages enjoy an engagement rate 6-8
        times higher than email marketing; 15% more contacts click on a link in an MMS message than click on a link in a
        text-only marketing message; and eight times as many contacts share MMS messages with families and friends, and
        across social media channels.</p>

    <p>In terms of coordinating contacts in times of emergency - or conference delegates, or community volunteers - MMS
        messages can be used to send maps, video updates, and voice broadcasts. Like plain text SMS messages, responses
        to MMS messages can be received by the group texting platform, or forwarded to an individual´s mobile device by
        SMS if access to an Internet service is not possible.</p>

<!--      Content 1        -->
<div class="text-left">
    <p><a href="http://www.eztexting.com/">EZ Texting</a>&nbsp;has been providing bulk text messaging services for
        businesses and organizations since 2006. Over time, we have developed our group texting platform to be&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.eztexting.com/ez-texting-features-helping-you-acquire-engage-and-service-customers">feature-rich</a>&nbsp;while
        remaining easy to use. We back our service with industry-leading customer support, so, although no special
        design or technical skills are required to use our service, there will always be help available if needed.</p>

    <p>Many of the features on our platform are designed for convenience. A scheduling feature enables businesses to
        compose messages in advance and send them when they will attract the most attention. The same feature can be
        used to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eztexting.com/features/advanced-messaging">send recurring or drip-feed
            marketing campaigns</a>. Sent messages can also be saved as templates to save time and effort when preparing
        future campaigns.</p>

    <p>Features to further increase the impact of messages include the option to customize bulk text messages by
        including each individual recipient's name. We also make it possible for businesses and organizations to create
        tiny URLs and QR Codes - QR codes being particularly effective if a quick response to a bulk text message is
        required - and our poll builder feature is incredibly versatile, yet still easy to use.</p>

    <p>For larger businesses and organizations, we can provide tools to integrate EZ Texting with popular web
        applications such as Salesforce and MailChimp, and APIs are available for developers who want to build our group
        texting platform into their own applications. We can also arrange for&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.eztexting.com/features/dedicated-short-code-services">dedicated short codes and vanity
            short codes</a>&nbsp;for businesses that want their short code number to be as memorable as their bulk text
        messages (an example of a vanity short code is 466453, which spells 'google' on a keypad).</p>
