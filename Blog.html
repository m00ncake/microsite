    Texting solutions can give your church a big bang for your buck. It costs just pennies to send texts which get
    extraordinary engagement rates.
</p>
<p>
    Text messages get better engagement rates than email and all other marketing channels by orders of magnitude.
    Contacts open only 21% of emails, whereas an internal study showed that <a
        href="https://www.eztexting.com/blog/42-unbelievable-text-message-marketing-statistics-will-blow-your-mind?_ga=2.6738226.1298514129.1555595134-1439933627.1542650599"
        rel=" noopener">98% of people who received text messages from our platform read them</a>.
</p>
<p>
    So, all you have to do is pick the first cheap church texting solution you come across and start blasting texts,
    right? Not so fast.
</p>
<p>
    Not all church texting services are made alike. You need a platform that is&nbsp;r<span>eliable,
        responsive,<span>&nbsp;</span></span>easy to use, has a robust feature set, friendly customer support, and, yes,
    a good price.
