<p>
    Welcome to EZ Texting! We are so glad that you’re interested in learning about our products. This is our terms of service, which governs all use of the services (including websites) provided by CallFire, Inc. d/b/a EZ Texting (hereinafter referred to as “EZ Texting”). Please review it carefully. By accessing or using any of our websites or services, you are agreeing these terms.
</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>

<p>The Terms of Service (“Terms”) applies to all access to or use of the EZ Texting websites, offerings, and services (collectively, “Services”). The Services are described in more detail in Section 3. EZ Texting provides you with these Services subject to your acceptance, without any modifications, of the Terms, as well as any other operating rules and policies that EZ Texting publishes on its website, such as our privacy policies (collectively, the “Agreement”). By accessing one of our Services, you represent that you have reached the age of majority for where you live or that you have had a parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<p>PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING ONE OF EZ Texting’S SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IT BECOMES A LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENT BETWEEN YOU AND EZ Texting. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO USE THE SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE ANY EZ Texting SERVICE; YOU SHOULD LEAVE THIS WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY BY CLOSING YOUR INTERNET BROWSER WINDOW.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p>We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time, and any revised Terms will supersede prior versions. Any updates to these Terms shall be posted on this website. Unless indicated otherwise, they will be effective on the date listed at the top of the Terms. You acknowledge your responsibility to review our Terms from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to use any of the EZ Texting Services after we post any such changes, you accept the revised Terms.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Parties</strong></p>

<p>2.1. Definitions. In this Agreement, “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to EZ Texting. “You,” “your,” and “Customer” refers to you personally, unless you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of an organization that does not have an existing contract with EZ Texting that governs your actions. If the latter is the case, you are accepting the Terms for that organization and representing that you have the authority to bind the organization to the Terms; as such, “you,” “your,” and “Customer” will refer to the organization. If the organization already has a separate contract with EZ Texting that covers your access and use of our Services, however, the contract will govern, as opposed to these Terms.</p>

<p>2.2. Affiliates. In this Agreement, an affiliate is an entity or person that controls a party, is controlled by a party, or is under common control with a party (such as a subsidiary, parent company, or employee). Each party to this Agreement will be responsible for the acts and omissions of their affiliates in connection with this Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>3. The Services</strong></p>

<p>
    When we refer to our Services in the Terms, we are referring to any of our platform services, including our programs, features, websites, account portals, and technical support. In addition to EZ Texting.com, EZ Texting provides Services through various other websites, including MoboMix.com, CallFire.com, GroupTexting.com, TellMyCell.com, NightLifeTexting.com, and ClubTexting.com. The Terms apply equally to any rebranded or white label version of EZ Texting’s platform services.
</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>4. Service Availability</strong></p>

<p>Services described on the EZ Texting Sites may or may not be available in all countries or regions of the world, may be available under different trademarks in different countries, and, where applicable, may be approved or cleared by a government regulatory body for sale or use with different indications and restrictions in different countries.</p>

<p>We transmit messages initiated by you or sent to you by others through different routes, and the level of reliability and support for special features varies according to the route. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer hardware, software, and communications equipment needed to access the Services and for paying all access charges (e.g., Internet Service Provider, telecommunications) incurred while using the Services.</p>

<p>EZ Texting only provides that the Services are processed correctly and further transmitted by EZ Texting to the applicable network. EZ Texting is not responsible for the final delivery of any communication initiated through EZ Texting’s Services, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of downstream communications carriers.</p>

<p>EZ Texting transmits and receives text messages and voice broadcasts via other major telecommunications companies and mobile network operators, and thus EZ Texting’s influence over the timing of the transmission of your messages and broadcasts is only within the technical constraints imposed upon EZ Texting. While EZ Texting shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit your messages and broadcasts to the applicable network for final delivery to your designated recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, and do not guarantee, a specific maximum delivery time. Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transmission of your messages and broadcasts across the public switched telephone network and/or Internet. You should know that communications carriers assign text messages and voice broadcasts with a default lifetime and any message or broadcast that cannot be delivered successfully within the lifetime assigned to it will be discarded by the communications carrier without any notice. EZ Texting is not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message or broadcast to be delivered, and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from EZ Texting for any such non-deliveries. Furthermore, you agree that message and broadcast contents are deemed to have zero value.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>5. Our Storage and Use of Your Data</strong></p>

<p>5.1. Privacy Policy. By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agree to the EZ Texting Services Privacy Policy and EZ Texting Sites Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of these privacy policies, you must stop using our Services immediately.</p>

<p>5.2. Deletion of Your Data. While our platform hosts some Customer data, the continued hosting and storage of your data is not guaranteed by us. Except as otherwise agreed between us in writing, we may occasionally delete your data, and we will not be liability for any damages, losses, or other consequences that you may incur as a result.</p>

<p><strong>6. Add-ons</strong></p>

<p>We may make additional features and products offered by third-parties (“Add-ons”) available on our Services. Your use of Add-ons available through our Services is subject to these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>7. Your Account</strong></p>

<p>Before you can use our Services, you must first create an account and provide us with some basic information, such as your full name, telephone number, email address, and account password.

You agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access to or use of our Services, and you will notify us promptly of any unauthorized access or use. Additionally, you agree to notify EZ Texting of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your user account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your username or password. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity related to our Services may be grounds for suspension or termination of your user account, in EZ Texting’s sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission rules, the National DNC list registry rules, and various state laws, rules, and regulations place restrictions on certain types of phone calls and text messages.

You are ultimately responsible to make your own informed decisions regarding your messages, broadcasts, and campaigns.</p>

<p>We may have copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in the Services, including the web pages that are part of the Services and the EZ Texting Sites.

<div class="policy-row">
<p>11.2. Compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. EZ Texting abides by the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by responding to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. As part of our response, we may remove or disable access to material residing on a site that is controlled or operated by EZ Texting and that is claimed to be infringing, in which case we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter notification, also in accordance with the DMCA. EZ Texting does not control content hosted on third party websites, and we cannot remove content from sites it does not own or control.</p>

<p>If you are the copyright owner of content hosted on a third party site, and you have not authorized the use of your content, please contact the administrator of that website directly to have the content removed.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p>Before serving either a Notice of Infringing Material or a Counter-Notification, you may wish to contact a lawyer to better understand your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws. The following notice requirements are intended to comply with EZ Texting’s rights and obligations under the DMCA and, in particular, section 512(c). They do not constitute legal advice.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">

</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>13. Payments</strong></p>

<p>Your use of our Services is contingent on your paying for such use (whether paid in advance or through the purchase of credits on the EZ Texting Sites), in the amounts and using the methods indicated on the EZ Texting Sites. Your payment for the Services, Credits (as defined below in Section 14), keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans (a portion of which also includes software maintenance and upgrades, as well as customer support) shall be deemed completed when EZ Texting receives the full amount of payment owed for such Services, Credits, keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans. You are responsible for paying for any message or broadcast you attempt to send to any number, regardless of whether the message is actually received by the intended recipient. As EZ Texting is dependent on other entities for the delivery of your messages and broadcasts, our price per credit may require adjustment in order to account for costs that are not in our control. Accordingly, we may adjust our prices from time to time and without prior notice.</p>

<p>EZ Texting will charge your indicated method of payment for the Services, Credits, keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees, and/or plans immediately upon your confirming the payment method and amount. Amounts to be charged may include sales and other taxes, where applicable, and any other amounts indicated on our Sites. EZ Texting will assess an additional charge based on the costs EZ Texting incurs for porting each DID number assigned to you that you request to be ported within six months of the original assignment by EZ Texting, and EZ Texting may further restrict your ability to port telephone numbers assigned to you by EZ Texting consistent with FCC regulations. Your account will be credited within 24 hours of EZ Texting verifying receipt of your payment. If you have elected to make a payment by credit card and we do not receive payment from the credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due immediately upon demand by EZ Texting.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p>EZ Texting cannot readily or accurately ascertain your location when you request to use the Services. You therefore agree that your use of the Services occurs in California and is subject to any applicable California taxes. To the extent that you are responsible for any additional taxes or fees beyond those collected by EZ Texting, you agree that you will pay them to any applicable taxing authority when due, including any interest or penalties assessed.</p>

<p>EZ Texting shall not be responsible for any errors or transmission failures with regard to the charging and collection of funds from your indicated payment method, nor for any actions taken by the provider of the payment method you choose (which could include refusal to authorize the charge). In addition to these Terms, any payments made by you may be subject to the agreement between you and the provider of the payment method.</p>

<p>As between you and EZ Texting, you are responsible for all charges related to purchases made using your account and payment method, whether or not you authorized such purchases. Standard charges apply to any test call sent originating from your account or initiated using your API key.</p>

<p>In the event of accidental under billing in favor of a Customer and a Customer’s subsequent nonpayment, EZ Texting shall be entitled to immediately proceed with collection remedies and shall be entitled to recover any and all costs, fees, and expenses of such collection efforts, including but not limited to: collection agencies, court costs, filing and service of process fees, attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel of EZ Texting’s choosing, or any other costs, fees, and expenses incurred in the pursuit of collection on all customer accounts and receivables due and payable under these Terms.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>14. Credits</strong></p>

<p>14.1. Using Credits. Credits are paperless vouchers that you purchase and which facilitate the transmission of the EZ Texting Services selected by you. Both the chosen route and the destination of a message or broadcast impact the amount of credits required for each transmission of our Services. Additionally, the value of credits may change over time as the cost of transmission changes, and thus you acknowledge that the number of credits needed to utilize the Services may change correspondingly. The pricing information, however, will always be made known beforehand through the Pricing Pages on our EZ Texting Sites. The submission of a seemingly-valid message or broadcast will cause an associated quantity of credits to be debited from your account, and you can obtain the real-time status of your account at any time through the online interface.</p>

<p>14.2. Expiration of Credits and Prepaid Minutes. Credits purchased as a part of a package or monthly plan (including any additional credits purchased during your monthly billing cycle as part of an upgrade to your plan) and not used within the month of purchase expire at the end of the month, unless the plan explicitly provides for a roll-over of credits. Individual anytime, nonmonthly plan credits purchased through your account automatically expire after 12&nbsp;months from the date of purchase, unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase. Credits are purchased on a first-bought, first-to-expire basis. Any unused value shall be forfeited upon expiration.</p>

<p>All prices, per-minute rates, and billing increments for credits are subject to change at any time due to fluctuations in market conditions. You may request a full refund of any unused, nonmonthly plan credits within one (1) business day of purchase. No other refunds will be given.</p>

<p>14.3. Right to Offer Customized Plans. Notwithstanding the above, we may, in our sole discretion, offer customized plans that provide for individualized terms concerning credit expiration, billing cycles, account maintenance fees, and other agreed-upon terms. We reserve the right to do so without publicly listing the pricing for these customized plans on our Sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>15. Fee Disputes</strong></p>

<p>You must notify us in writing if you dispute any portion of any fees paid or payable by you under this Agreement. You must provide that written notice to us within ninety (90) days of the applicable charge, and we will work together with you to promptly resolve the applicable dispute. If you do not provide us with this written notice of your fee dispute within this 90-day period, you will not be entitled to dispute any fees paid or payable by you.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>16. No Warranty; Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

<p>EZ Texting reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the offering of any of the EZ Texting Services at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Further, while EZ Texting utilizes electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of data during transmission and storage, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the data and shall not be liable for breaches of security or integrity, third-party interception in transit, or any damage caused to your computer or other property by your use of the EZ Texting Services.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that text messages and voice broadcasts are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping of communications by third parties is possible. EZ Texting recommends that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is communicated by a protected and/or encrypted method.</p>

<p>EZ Texting shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make access to the Services available through the required access protocols, but makes no warranty or guarantee that (i) the Services will be available at any particular time; or (ii) you will be able to access the Services at any particular time or from any particular location. EZ Texting will not be liable for any act or omission of any other company or companies furnishing a portion of the Services (including, without limitation communications carriers or ISPs); for any act or omission of a third party (including those vendors participating in EZ Texting offerings made to you); for equipment that we do not furnish; or for damages that result from the operation of customer-provided systems, equipment, facilities, or services that are interconnected with the Service.</p>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>23. Choice of Law</strong></p>

<p>The enforceability and interpretation of Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be determined in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9. U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended (the “Federal Arbitration Act”), including its procedural provisions. Apart from Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate), the Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive law of the State of Texas (subject to any applicable preemption or supersedence by U.S. federal substantive law) without regard to conflict of law principles that would cause laws of another jurisdiction to apply.</p>

<p><strong>24. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>

<p>Most disputes can be resolved by contacting our Customer Support team. We strongly encourage you to reach out to them before you decide to bring a formal legal case.</p>

<p>24.1. We Both Agree to Arbitrate. If we are not able to successfully work together to resolve the dispute, you (and any of your affiliates) and EZ Texting (and any of our affiliates) all agree to resolve any dispute arising under these Terms (including our privacy policies) or any dispute relating to our Services by binding arbitration in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>This agreement to arbitrate applies to all claims under any legal theory, including any claim that requires the interpretation of this document, except for the exception below in subsection 24.2 (Exception to Agreement to Arbitrate). This agreement also continues to apply after you have stopped using our Services. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or whether it applies to the dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that as well.</p>

<p>In addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or if any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Any of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p>24.2. Exception to Agreement to Arbitrate. Anything in the foregoing paragraphs to the contrary notwithstanding, EZ Texting may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties to enjoin or prevent any action you take or threaten to take in violation of these Terms. Moreover, you consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>

<p>24.3. Arbitration Procedure. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“Rules”) then in effect shall apply to the arbitration, except to the extent that they conflict with any express provisions in this Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate).</p>

<p>A single independent arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration. The parties shall endeavor to select the independent arbitrator by mutual agreement. The arbitrator shall be a member of a state bar engaged in the practice of law in the United States or a retired member of a state or the federal judiciary in the United States. If the dispute is one to be decided by arbitration and such agreement cannot be reached within thirty (30) days after the dispute first arose, the selection of the arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the Rules as then in effect.</p>

<p>Each party shall be entitled to inspect and obtain a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party. All such discovery shall be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. Unless otherwise provided in the award, each party shall bear its own costs of discovery.</p>

<p>The award of the arbitrator shall be based on the evidence admitted and shall contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award shall be made within thirty (30) days following the close of the final hearing and the filing of any post-hearing briefs authorized by the arbitrator. It shall set forth in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for the award. The arbitrator may, in his/her discretion, award to any party specific performance or injunctive relief (but the foregoing is not intended to limit EZ Texting’s access to the courts to the extent provided in subsection 24.2). The arbitrator may not change, modify, or alter any express condition, term, or provision of these Terms.</p>

<p>Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding upon the parties, and no appeal of any kind may be taken. Judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The statute of limitations applicable under Texas law to the commencement of a lawsuit shall apply to the commencement of arbitration hereunder.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p>24.4. Recovery of Costs and Attorney’s Fees. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, EZ Texting and any of its affiliates will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees if we substantially prevail.</p>

<p>24.5. Class Action Waiver. Both you (and your affiliates) and EZ Texting (and our affiliates) agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other only on an individual basis. Neither you (and your affiliates) nor EZ Texting (and our affiliates) can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person or entity’s claims into a single case and cannot preside over any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). Moreover, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other EZ Texting customers; it cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.</p>

<p>If a court decides that this subsection 24.5 (Class Action Waiver) is unenforceable or invalid, then the entire Section 24 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null and void. But the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>25. Entire Agreement</strong></p>

<p>The Terms are only those stated herein, and they shall constitute the complete agreement between the parties.

</div>

<div class="policy-row">
<p><strong>27. No Waiver</strong></p>

<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by both parties to be legally binding.</p>

<p><strong>28. Relationship of the Parties</strong></p>

<p>You and EZ Texting are each independent contractors in the performance of each and every part of these Terms.
