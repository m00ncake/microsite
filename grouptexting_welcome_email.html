    <h2 style='font-size:18px; display: inline;'>See What You Can Do In Less Than Three Minutes<br /></h2>
    Before we get started, we want you to know that our Client Success Managers are here to help. If you have questions,
    give us a call at 212-201-9934. See our <a href="http://grouptexting.com/contact.php">contact page</a> for email,
    chat and other support options.<br>
    <p>Ready to see what you can do? If you've already activated your account and logged in, head over to the <a
            href="https://app.grouptexting.com/sending/messages/choose-method"><strong>Send Text Message</strong>
            <strong>page</strong></a>. There are three default groups in your account, but they're empty right now. Try
        sending a message to a single number using the single number field. You'll have an opportunity to preview your
        message before you send it.</p>
    <p>You should receive your message in under a minute. When you do, text back a reply like <em>It works!</em> Head
        over to your <a href="https://app.grouptexting.com/messages/Inbox"><strong>Group Texting Inbox.</strong></a>
        Whenever anyone replies to your messages, those responses are automatically delivered to your Inbox. </p>
    <p>Replies aren't the only way to receive messages from your customers and contacts. <strong><a
                href="https://app.grouptexting.com/keywords">Keywords</a></strong> allow people to text a word to our
        short code to join your list of <a href="https://app.grouptexting.com/contacts/"><strong>Contacts</strong></a>.
        If you want to see how Keywords work, try texting Joes to (760) 670-3130 . </p>
    <p>Most Group Texting clients use Keywords - and you can rent them individually, or <strong><a
                href="https://app.grouptexting.com/billing/plans">upgrade to a monthly plan</a></strong> that includes
        free Keywords.</p>
    <p>The Contacts page lists all of your contacts, which you can assign to different Groups. <strong><a
                href="https://app.grouptexting.com/groups">Groups</a></strong> allow you to send a message to everyone
        in the group at once, whether there are 10 people or 10,000 people in the group. </p>
    <p>If you already have a list of opted-in contacts, you can <a
            href="https://app.grouptexting.com/contacts/import/"><strong>Upload Your Contacts</strong></a> and assign
        them to a group.</p>
    <p>When you're ready to send your first campaign, <a
            href="https://app.grouptexting.com/billing/credits/"><strong>buy some credits</strong></a> or <a
            href="https://app.grouptexting.com/billing/plans"><strong>upgrade to a monthly plan</strong></a>.</p>
