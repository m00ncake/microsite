    connect our Customers with one another. For example, we may use your Customer Data to offer you the opportunity to connect with other Customers who you might know or who might share similar characteristics, such as location or industry. We may also suggest connections between Customers whose calls, messages, broadcasts, or campaigns target similar Contacts based on analyses of Customers&rsquo; Contact Data or other anonymized aggregated data.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet bullet-left">
    allow Customers to engage, interact, and communicate with one another about their uses of our Services.

 <p>
 <strong>4. Consent for Use of Confidential Data and Customer Proprietary Network Information</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 In order to better serve our Customers&rsquo; needs and to offer them additional products and services, EZ Texting may analyze certain information about their usage of our Services. Such analyses will be based on your anonymized, aggregated data, and any information belonging to you will not be personally identifiable.

 </p>
 <p class="bullet bullet-left">
 <strong>Customer Proprietary Network Information</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 Information that is made available to the EZ Texting solely by virtue of your relationship with us as a telecommunications carrier is known under FCC regulations as&nbsp;Customer Proprietary Network Information&nbsp;(&quot;CPNI&quot;). This carrier-acquired, generated, or maintained information relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and usage amount of your telecommunications services purchased from EZ Texting. It also includes the content of specific telecommunications that Customers make or receive, as well as the related local and toll billing information.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet-left">
 EZ Texting acknowledges its duty under federal law and/or any applicable state law to take reasonable measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your CPNI.
 </p>
 <p class="bullet bullet-left">
 <strong>Confidential Information</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 In some circumstances, EZ Texting may include in its analyses Confidential Information (&quot;CI&quot;) that is not covered under the definition of CPNI, such as your subscriber list or published information (listed or unlisted). CI could include information like your name, telephone number, address, and information related to non-telecommunications aspects of our Services. We use your CI solely on an anonymized basis.
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="policy-row">
 <p>
    By using our Services, you grant EZ Texting permission to use any CI and CPNI for the purpose of improving your experience with our Services, providing insight into how you and other Customers use our Services, and offering you any and all products and services available from us, including offerings that are different from those you currently buy from us.<br />
 <br>
    You have a right to disapprove of our uses of your CPNI and CI as set forth above. You may withdraw the permission you have granted us by agreeing to these terms at any time by notifying us in writing at <a href="mailto:support@callfire.com">support@CallFire.com</a>.

 <div class="policy-row">
 <p>
 <strong>5. Sharing of Information Collected</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 We may share Customer Data and Customers&rsquo; Contact Data with third-party service providers or others who need access to the data to perform their work on our behalf. For example, we may store this information on third-party servers. Additionally, EZ Texting may share information provided by Customers and Visitors with our agents so that these agents can contact them on our behalf. EZ Texting may also share this information with our agents to ensure the quality of information provided. EZ Texting does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.<br />
 <br />
    EZ Texting uses a third party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.<br />
 <br />
    EZ Texting reserves the right to disclose personal information about Customers or Visitors if required by law, if we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, or if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the public from harm.<br/>
 <br />
 If we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event, the Customer Data and Customers&rsquo; Contact Data that we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction. Any acquirer or successor of EZ Texting may continue to use that data as set forth in this Privacy Statement.
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>6. Customers&rsquo; Contact Data</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
    EZ Texting Customers use our Services to host data and information. Such information usually includes Customers&rsquo; Contact Data, such as data about the contacts they wish to communicate with by using our platform. EZ Texting  processes Customers’ Contact Data on behalf of our Customers. We only use Customers’ Contact Data for the purpose of providing Services to our Customers.<br/>
 <br />
 6.1. Release of Contact Data. By uploading your Contact Data to our Services, you release this information to us.<br />
 <br />
 6.2. Right to Store and Use the Contact Data. By uploading your Contact Data to our Services, you represent that you have the right to store and otherwise use that Contact Data on our Services, as well as the right to communicate with the Contact using that information.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
 6.4. Requests for Deletion of Contact Data by the Contact. Any Contact of a EZ Texting Customer who would like their data to be deleted from a Customer&rsquo;s account should send such requests directly to the Customer. If contacted, however, EZ Texting will make our best effort to accommodate requests that appear to be genuine and legitimate.

 <div class="policy-row">
 <p>
 <strong>7. Friend Referral and Customer Testimonials</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
     Customers and Visitors may elect to use our referral service to inform their friends about our Sites. When using the referral service, EZ Texting requests the friend&#39;s name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Sites. We do not store this information. Customers and Visitors are responsible for obtaining the consent of any friend or referral that you provide to us.<br/>  
 <br />
 EZ Texting posts a list of Customers and testimonials on our Sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. EZ Texting obtains the consent of our Customers prior to posting this information and Customer testimonials.
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="policy-row">
 <p>
 <strong>8. Security</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
 EZ Texting uses proper security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access and to maintain that data&rsquo;s accuracy. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (&quot;SSL&quot;) technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. EZ Texting has also implemented an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and we host our Sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.<br />
 <br />
 These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. EZ Texting also offers additional enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to provide an even greater level of security.<br />
 <br />
 EZ Texting secures Customers&rsquo; Contact Data in the same manner as that described above for securing Customer Data.<br />
 <br />
 While EZ Texting utilizes electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of data during transmission and storage, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the data and shall not be liable for breaches of security or integrity, third-party interception in transit, or any damage caused to your computer or other property by your use of the EZ Texting Services.
